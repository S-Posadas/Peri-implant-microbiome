This code was used to analyze the oral microbiome of patients who underwent microvascular jaw reconstructions. Peri-implant microbiota samples were collected around natural teeth and zirconia implants inserted into fibula-free and deep circumflex iliac artery (DCIA) flaps immediately after implant surgery, as well as 3 and 12 months later. Illumina paired-end shotgun metagenomic sequencing was performed following standard genomic library preparation protocols.
